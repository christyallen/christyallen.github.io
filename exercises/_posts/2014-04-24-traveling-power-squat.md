You'll need ONE 5- or 8-pound dumbbell. Stand holding the weight horizontally (ONLY ONE WEIGHT HELD AT CHEST LEVEL) in front of your ribcage with both hands. Lower your hips into a squat and hold for 2 seconds, then jump up explosively as if you're reaching over a volleyball net. As you jump, lift the dumbbell over your head, fully extending your arms.Return the weight immediately back to your ribcage at the bottom of the jump. Beginners should start with 30 seconds and an intermediate should aim for 60 seconds. The Travelling Power Squat targets your legs, glutes, repeat. Go as low into the squat as you can without letting your knees move pass your toes. Be sure to tuck your tail bone under and contract your glutes. Keep your torso tall and don't let your knees creep pass your toes. **MODIFICATION: TAKE JUMP OUT: SQUAT THEN RAISE UP ONTO TOES**
