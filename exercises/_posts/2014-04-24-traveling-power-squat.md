ONE 5- or 8-pound dumbbell. 

Stand holding the weight horizontally (ONLY ONE WEIGHT HELD AT CHEST LEVEL) in front of your ribcage with both hands. 

Lower your hips into a squat and hold for 2 seconds, then jump up explosively. 

As you jump, lift the dumbbell over your head, fully extending your arms.

Return the weight immediately back to your ribcage at the bottom of the jump. **MODIFICATION: TAKE JUMP OUT: SQUAT THEN RAISE UP ONTO TOES**
