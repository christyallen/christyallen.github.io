Stand with your feet under your hips. Grasp a dumbbell in each hand with your elbows bent and hands at ear height. B. Jump your feet out into a wide angle as you press the dumbbells overhead, keeping them above your shoulders. Bring your feet back together as you lower the dumbbells. This completes one rep.
