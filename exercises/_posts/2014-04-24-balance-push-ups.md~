Lie face down on the ball with hands and feet touching the ground and the stomach on the top of the ball. 

Walk the hands out until the shins (**ADVANCED: OR THE TOES**) are resting on the ball and the torso is in a flat push-up position. 

Lower the torso towards the ground until the upper arms are parallel to the ground. Return to the “up” push-up position
