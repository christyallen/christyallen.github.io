4 cycles

- Start in 45 degree slouched position, hands on sides of knee caps (**advanced** hold 2-5 lb weights)
- Explode kicking feet out wide and bringing arms up to clap above 
head (full range of motion-really high, really quick)
- Landing back in crouched position
- keep chest open, avoid rounding back, everything in straight line
- land with feet together
