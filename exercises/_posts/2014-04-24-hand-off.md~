Lie face up on the ground with arms and legs extended. 

Grab the ball overhead with both hands. 

In one smooth motion, lift the arms and legs in the air, transferring the ball from the hands to the feet (in between the ankles to be exact). At this point, only the hips and butt should be touching the ground. 

Lower arms and legs with the ball between them to the ground.
