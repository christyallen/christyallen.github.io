- Start with 25 jumping jacks; engage transversus abdominis and keep shoulders depressed.
- Progress to 12 mountain climbers, which are great for engaging core musculature.
- Do 5 pairs of walking lunges to get blood flowing to large leg muscles.
- Finally, perform high-knee jog, moving laterally to right (R) for five steps. Pause on step five with knee held high, chest open and abdominals engaged. Then do same pattern, moving left (L). Steps should be quick, powerful and athletic. Continue for approximately 30 seconds.
