Start on floor in plank position, balancing on forearms and toes, elbows directly under shoulders. 

Clasp hands together. Lift right leg behind you as high as you can, then lower it without touching toes to floor and bring it out to right side. 

Return right leg to center, then repeat without touching toes to floor.
