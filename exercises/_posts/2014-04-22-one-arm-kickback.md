“take a knee”, then prop your left arm on your knee, holding weight in your right hand, tuck your arm next to your side then extend the arm backwards, bending at the elbow.
advanced move: instead of propping the left arm on a bent knee, kick the left leg straight behind you and prop yourself up on your left arm.
