(using dumbbell because back muscles are large group muscles and they need harder exercises)
Legs apart, wider than shouldersâ€¦.Left toe pointing forward, right toe points out.. Place your right elbow on your right knee.
Hold dumbbell in the left hand near the right foot...keep back straight.
Extend Left arm down as much as possible then raise weight like you are putting it in your pocket, then back down.  repeat with same arm.
