Lie on the floor with arms extended perpendicular to the torso and lower calves and heels resting on the ball. 

Engaging the glutes and abs, lift the hips up from the floor. 

Use the outstretched arms for stability

Bring the knees in towards the hips, so the feet are resting flat on top of the ball. 

Straighten legs out again. Keep those hips up the whole time.
