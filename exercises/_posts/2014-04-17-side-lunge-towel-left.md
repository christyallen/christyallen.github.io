Stand with your feet together and place your right foot on top of a folded towel. Shifting your weight to your left leg , slide the towel out slowly to your right, then slowly return to the start position . Repeat. You'll work this side for 30 seconds before switching. Keep your elbows bent, and your fists together near your chin. When you squat, your left knee should bend between 45 and 90 degrees. After 30 seconds, switch legs and do squats for another 30 seconds, sliding your left leg to the side, and squatting with your right leg. The Single-Leg Squat with Towel targets your inner and outer thighs as well as your quads and glutes. When you're done with this exercise, you'll have only 1 minute left in the workout.
