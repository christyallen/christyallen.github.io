- Stand with your feet shoulder-distance apart, holding a medicine ball.
- Take a large step diagonally forward with your left foot, planting it at the 1 o'clock position. Sink down until your thighs form right angles. Keep the medicine ball stable.
- Extend your legs, then lift your left knee and bring it in toward your chest. Step back with your left leg, this time lunging behind your torso and stepping back to the 4 o'clock position as you sink down into the reverse lunge. This completes one rep. Complete your set, then switch sides.
