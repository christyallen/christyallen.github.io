Stand with your left foot on a low box (or step) and your right foot on the floor about two feet to the right of the box. Bend your knees slightly, keep your chest up, and bend your arms 90 degrees, keeping your elbows close to your body (a). Push off your left foot and jump to your left, landing with your right foot on the box (b) and your left foot on the floor, knees bent (c). Push off your right foot to jump back to the starting position. That's one rep. Do 10.

**Option: For 2 cycles - Jump both feet on and off the box**
